# Example 1: FastAPI Response Header Validation (Exemplar)

This is an **exemplary** example demonstrating a well-crafted feature request problem.

## Problem Overview

**Language**: Python
**Category**: Feature Request
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Why This is Exemplary

This example represents the gold standard for problem creation:

1. **Realistic & Reasonable Problem**: Addresses a genuine gap in FastAPI's validation system that developers would actually encounter
2. **High-Level Problem Brief**: Focuses on the user-facing issue (catching header bugs in development vs production) without prescribing implementation
3. **Clear Agent Instructions**: Provides directional guidance ("add response_headers parameter", "raise an error") while leaving room for implementation decisions
4. **Behavior-Focused Tests**: Validates that the feature works (headers are validated, errors are raised) without dictating exact implementation details
5. **Appropriate Scope**: Medium difficulty - requires understanding FastAPI patterns but doesn't demand architectural changes

## Key Characteristics

- Adds new functionality to an existing framework
- Problem description emphasizes *what* and *why*, not *how*
- Instructions are imperative but not prescriptive
- Tests validate behavior, not implementation specifics
- Introduces new public interfaces with clear naming guidance
