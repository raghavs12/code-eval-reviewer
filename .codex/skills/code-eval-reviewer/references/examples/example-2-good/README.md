# Example 2: Pydantic Fraction Serialization Fix (Good)

This is a **good** example with room for improvement in the problem description.

## Problem Overview

**Language**: Python

**Category**: Feature Request

**Difficulty**: Medium

## Why This is Mostly Good

This example demonstrates solid problem creation with small adjustments needed:

1. **Realistic Problem**: Addresses a genuine inconsistency in Pydantic's handling of numeric types
2. **Clear User Impact**: Explains how the current behavior is confusing for developers
3. **Well-Scoped Solution**: Proposes specific, implementable changes


## What Could Be Improved
- Too Prescriptive**: The "Proposed Solution" section is a bit too detailed, giving away implementation specifics that should be left to the developer to figure out. 
- A better approach would be to describe the *behavior* and let the solver figure out the implementation.
